# Indian Cars: Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a dataset on Indian car sales with extensive information about various aspects related to passenger cars. The dataset comprises 141 columns, providing a rich source for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

## Overview

In May 2023, the Indian car market witnessed the sale of approximately 3.34 Lakh passenger cars, marking a notable 13% increase compared to the previous year. The top 25 selling cars contributed to over 75% of the total cars sold in April 2023.

## Libraries Used for Visualization

1. Seaborn
2. Plotly
3. Matplotlib
4. Pandas

## Analysis Steps

### Univariate Analysis

1. **Understand Dataset:**
   - Explore the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values through removal or imputation based on data characteristics.

3. **Data Types:**
   - Check and ensure appropriate data types for each column.

4. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculate basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max, std) for numeric columns.

5. **Histograms:**
   - Create histograms to visualize the distribution of key numeric variables (e.g., sales, price).

6. **Bar Charts:**
   - Plot bar charts to represent the count of categorical variables (e.g., car models, manufacturers).

7. **Box Plots:**
   - Use box plots to identify outliers and understand the distribution of numeric variables.

8. **Pie Charts:**
   - Represent the contribution of different car models or manufacturers using pie charts.

9. **Count Plots:**
   - Visualize the count of observations for categorical variables using count plots.

### Bivariate Analysis

1. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Create a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numeric variables.

2. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Plot scatter plots to explore relationships between two numeric variables (e.g., sales vs. price).

3. **Pair Plots:**
   - Use pair plots for a quick overview of relationships between multiple numeric variables.

4. **Bar Charts with Hue:**
   - Enhance bar charts by introducing the 'hue' parameter to represent additional categorical variables.

5. **Heatmaps:**
   - Utilize heatmaps to visually represent the correlation matrix for better insights.

6. **Joint Plots:**
   - Use joint plots to display the distribution of two numeric variables and their relationship.

7. **Box Plots with Hue:**
   - Enhance box plots by introducing the 'hue' parameter to represent additional categorical variables.

8. **Categorical Plots:**
   - Explore relationships between categorical and numeric variables using categorical plots.

9. **Violin Plots:**
   - Visualize the distribution of numeric variables across different categories using violin plots.

10. **Stacked Bar Charts:**
    - Represent the combined contribution of different categories using stacked bar charts.

11. **Insights and Documentation:**
    - Document key findings and insights obtained from both univariate and bivariate analyses. Utilize graphs and visualizations to support observations.
